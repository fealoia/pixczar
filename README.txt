How to Compile/Execute: "./make.sh"
  make.sh script should do the following:
  1. Compile the files and produce a executable pixczar.native
  2. Test the executable against the tests within the tests directory and return
  information on the success of the tests
    a.  - Green text indicates expected output for a test
        - Red text indicates unexpected output for a test
        -Ex: "./pixczar.native shouldfail.pxr" should print FAILURE in green
  3. Create a file tester.ll which contains the LLVM code generated by codegen
  on the helloworld.pxr file provided
  4. Compile and execute the LLVM file and print out "Hello World" to terminal

*** make.sh exports specific path of llvm found in the group's computer. If llvm
is located in another directory then the function will not build. To fix problem
please change the path to the users appropriate llvm directory ***

*** make.sh uses "-ocamlfind" and "lli" to compile source code so it is assumed
that these compiling tools are already downloaded on user's computer ***

helloworld.pxr is our simple tester function that prints Hello World to the terminal screen

The make.sh script checks to see if the output printed to the terminal is the
string 'Hello World'. If it matches the string then it prints out a success message,
if it doesn't match then it prints out a failure message.
